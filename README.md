Homework 3 - Jin Son

This app allows the users to change the username, click on next, play, previous buttons.
And now it also supports recyclerview. It also shows a miniplayer when clicked on a song, which if clicked, 
can open up a new activity that shows detailed information about the song. 
This app now allows the support of orientation shift, and fragments.

<img src="/songPlayerLandscape.png" alt="Screenshot of the app v3" height="300" />
<img src="/fragmentProfile.png" alt="Screenshot of the app v3" height="300" />

Extra credit attempted : 
- 1. Every Fragment (other than SettingsFragment) has a Up/back button in the top right corner. Clicking
     will take you back to the previous fragment (+.25)
     
- 2. Instead of the settings button, there is an action button in the app bar (+0.25)
