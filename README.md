Homework 5 - Jin Son

This app allows the users to click on next, play, previous buttons.
And now it also supports recyclerview. It also shows a miniplayer when clicked on a song, which if clicked, 
can open up a new activity that shows detailed information about the song. 
This app now fetches songs from a remote server using HTTPS requests, and loads album covers of the fetched songs.  
The app also sends notifications, if clicked, launches the player with the song information
